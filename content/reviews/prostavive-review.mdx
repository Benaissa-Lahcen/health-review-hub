## What is ProstaVive?

ProstaVive is a dietary supplement designed to support healthy prostate function, improve urinary flow, and boost male vitality.

**The Big Difference:** Unlike 99% of prostate supplements that come in hard-to-swallow capsules, ProstaVive is a **powdered drink mix**. You simply mix a scoop with water or your favorite beverage once a day.

It aims to optimize blood flow and nitric oxide levels, which helps nutrient-rich blood reach the prostate to support healthy cell metabolism.

## How Does It Work? (The Nitric Oxide Connection)

The core mechanism of ProstaVive revolves around **Nitric Oxide (NO)** and Hemodynamics.

As men age, blood flow to the prostate can diminish, leading to a buildup of toxins and inflammatory cells. ProstaVive's formula is rich in ingredients that support nitric oxide levels. NO acts as a "vasodilator," relaxing the inner muscles of your blood vessels.

**🩸 The "Flow" Effect:** By widening these vessels, ProstaVive claims to:
- **Flush out toxins** from the prostate area effectively
- **Deliver essential nutrients** and oxygen directly to prostate cells
- **Reduce pressure** on the urethra, stopping that "constant urge" to go
