## The "Old Way" vs. The New Way

We've all been told the same story since childhood: brush, floss, and use mouthwash. But if that's the golden rule, why do so many of us still struggle with cavities, sensitive gums, and bad breath?

Recent scientific discoveries have shifted the focus from "killing bad bacteria" to **"feeding good bacteria."** This is where ProDentim comes in. Unlike traditional dental products that might strip your mouth of its natural defense system, ProDentim claims to repopulate your oral ecosystem.

## What is ProDentim?

ProDentim is a unique dental health supplement that comes in the form of a **soft, dissolvable candy**. It is not a toothpaste or a mouthwash.

**The Strategy:** It delivers 3.5 billion probiotic strains directly into your mouth. The core philosophy is that modern toothpastes often contain toxic ingredients that destroy the mouth's microbiome. ProDentim aims to reverse this damage by reintroducing friendly bacteria.

---

## How Does It Work? (The "Microbiome Theory")

The efficacy of ProDentim relies on the "Microbiome Theory." A study referenced by the manufacturers suggests that people with perfect teeth have a high population of "good bacteria."

When you chew a ProDentim tablet, it melts and coats your gums to:
- **Balance** the oral microbiome immediately
- **Fight inflammation** in the gums (Gingivitis)
- **Keep sinuses open** and support the respiratory tract
